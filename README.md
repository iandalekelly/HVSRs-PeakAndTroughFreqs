# Inversion of HVSR peak (and trough) frequencies

This repository supports **KELLY ET AL. (????)**, providing a Python workflow demonstrating the misfit frameworks of eqs. (8) and (10) using HVSR peak (and trough) frequencies for the inversion of subglacial low-velocity zones in Antarctica.

The workflow uses:

1. Version 1.0.0 of the [`hvsrpy`](https://github.com/jpvantassel/hvsrpy) package for HVSR data processing ([Vantassel, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1785/0220240395));
2. The Python implementation ([`neighpy`](https://github.com/auggiemarignier/neighpy)) of the Neighbourhood Algorithm ([Sambridge, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-246X.1999.00876.x));
3. A Python implementation of the body-wave forward model ([Herak, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2007.07.009)), adapted from the Matlab code provided in the supplementary material of [Albarello et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggad109).
